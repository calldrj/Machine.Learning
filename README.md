These are Machine Learning Exercises I coded for COMP 542       
Most of them were written in MatLab (with extension .m)
In some of those Matlab functions, I reused the code in Simon Rogers and Mark Girolami's book,    
A First Course in Machine Learning, 2nd Edition, 2016, ISBN 978-1498738484.
In some exercises, I used Python and R to program because I found it would be simpler to do so     
instead of coding in Matlab.
Each .pdf file associated with individual exercise shows the outputs of the corresponding program.
