These are Machine Learning Exercises I coded for COMP 542.           
Most of them were written in MatLab (with extension .m).    
The codes in Simon Rogers and Mark Girolami's book, A First Course in Machine Learning, 2nd Edition,     
were reused in some of those Matlab functions.
In some exercises, I used Python and R to implement because I found it would be simpler to do so       
instead of coding in Matlab.   
Each .pdf file associated with individual exercise shows the outputs of the corresponding program.
